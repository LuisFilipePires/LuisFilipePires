## 👋 Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!  

# 👨‍💻 Luis Filipe Fernandes Pires  

**Aspiring Software Developer | 42 Luxembourg Student | Data Enthusiast**  

I’m a career shifter with strong discipline and dedication, currently studying at [42 Luxembourg](https://42luxembourg.lu).  
My background in team leadership and years of professional experience taught me **resilience, responsibility, and teamwork** – values I now bring to the world of software development.  

🔹 Passionate about **C, C++, Python and system programming**  
🔹 Interested in **web technologies, and blockchain**  
🔹 Always learning, building, and sharing projects  

💡 At 42, I’ve been immersed in a **peer-to-peer, project-based methodology** that has strengthened my ability to **learn autonomously, adapt quickly to new technologies, and tackle complex challenges**.  
This unique approach makes me confident in picking up new languages or frameworks efficiently, while developing strong problem-solving and collaboration skills. 

💡 My goal: **to grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects that make an impact.**
